Today is the first day of my second batch at the [Recurse Centre](https://www.recurse.com/).

My first batch was in the spring of 2015 and it was a life-changing experience, not just for all the things I learned (**a lot**), but also for all the wonderful people I've met during and after my time in NYC. RC completely changed the way I think about my career and personal relationships and has empowered me to be a better human on so many levels it's hard to even put it all in words.

I'm currently in between jobs and the pandemic has made immigration matters a tad more complicated so my start date has been delayed, and while being indefinitely waiting on a work permit and being quarantined in a foreign country may be less than ideal, I can't think of a better way of spending the next few (several?) weeks than returning to RC.

During my first batch, I struggled a lot with being public about my work and my ideas. Whether it was about writing a blog post, or giving a presentation, I couldn't get over the little voice in my head telling me there wasn't anything _worth sharing_. And what would I even write/talk about?

A lot has changed since then. I gave my first conference talk at PyData Amsterdam in 2016 and I've been doing increasingly more public speaking in the last couple of years. So when I applied for this batch I told myself (and the RC faculty, to be fair) that I'd make an effort to be more _out there_, no matter how imperfect the content might be.

This blog is an attempt at keeping myself accountable and also keeping track of my progress throught the batch. I won't set a schedule, but I'm hoping to post consinstent updates as this new batch unfolds and I push the little voice out of my head.
